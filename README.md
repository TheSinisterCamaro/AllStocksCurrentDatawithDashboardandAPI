Roadmap and Progress
1. Initial Concept and Setup
Objective: Develop an automated tool that performs end-to-end stock analysis and prediction using free tools accessible at home.
Initial Plan: Collect data from Yahoo Finance, perform data cleaning, train a machine learning model, and visualize the results.
Challenge: Ensuring that the entire process is fully automated without manual intervention.

2. Data Collection and Cleaning
Data Source: I integrated the yfinance library to automate the collection of historical stock data. The data was collected for the stock ticker specified by the user, with a default range from 2010 to the present.
Initial Challenge: Handling missing values in the dataset was critical for maintaining the integrity of the analysis.
Solution: Implemented linear interpolation to fill in missing values. This method was chosen because it maintains the continuity of the data without introducing significant bias.
Testing: I tested with several stocks to ensure the data collection and cleaning process worked across different scenarios, validating the output at each stage.

3. Feature Engineering
Objective: To prepare the data for machine learning by calculating key technical indicators.
Features Added:
- 20-Day Moving Average (MA_20)
- 50-Day Moving Average (MA_50)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Volatility
- Iteration and Testing:
- Initially, basic Moving Averages were implemented and tested for their impact on model performance.
The RSI and Volatility calculations were added in subsequent iterations, with multiple test runs to ensure the calculations were correctly applied and contributed to model accuracy.
I checked the generated features by plotting them to ensure they reflected the expected market behaviors.

4. Model Training and Prediction
Initial Model: I started with a simple linear regression model to predict future stock prices.
- Challenge: The initial predictions were flat lines, indicating that the model was not capturing the time series nature of the data.
- Solution: I switched to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is better suited for sequential data.

LSTM Model:
Implementation: The LSTM model was implemented with two LSTM layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Training: I trained the model on the prepared dataset, scaling the data using MinMaxScaler to improve model performance.
Iterations:
 - Initial Tests: Early implementations of the LSTM model still showed some issues, such as minimal movement in the predicted values. This led to further tuning of the modelâ€™s architecture and parameters.
 - Enhancements: We tested various LSTM configurations, including adjustments to the number of units in the layers, the dropout rates, and the number of epochs. These adjustments were repeatedly tested until satisfactory predictive performance was achieved.
Result: After multiple iterations and refinements, the LSTM model produced more realistic predictions, showing expected market trends over the forecast period.

5. Interactive Dashboard Development
Objective: To create a user-friendly way for users to visualize the analysis results.
Initial Approach: The results were initially plotted using matplotlib and saved as static images.
 - Challenge: Static images were not interactive and did not allow users to explore the data in depth.
Solution: We integrated Dash to build an interactive web-based dashboard.
 - Development Process:
  - We started by setting up a simple Dash app to display the historical prices.
  - Iteratively added more features, including plots for RSI and Volatility, and finally integrated the LSTM model's predictions into the dashboard.
  - Testing: We tested the dashboard for different stocks to ensure the visualizations were correct and that the dashboard was responsive.
Final Product: The dashboard provides an interactive experience where users can view historical data, technical indicators, and future predictions.

6. GUI Development
Initial Interface: The first version of the GUI was created using tkinter, allowing users to input the stock ticker and run the analysis.
 - Challenge: The GUI initially provided limited feedback, making it unclear whether the analysis was running or had stalled.
Enhancements:
 - Progress Bar: We added a progress bar that updates as different stages of the analysis are completed.
 - Detail Window: A window was added to display detailed messages indicating the current task (e.g., "Collecting data," "Training model").
 - Feedback Improvement: The GUI was further improved to include a "Running..." animation to indicate ongoing processing.
 - Multiprocessing Issues: We encountered issues related to pickling tkinter objects when using multiprocessing. To solve this, I refactored the code to avoid passing tkinter objects between processes and used shared variables to manage the progress and status updates.

7. Multiprocessing and Performance Optimization
Initial Challenge: The tool's resource usage was higher than expected, particularly during model training and prediction.
Solution: Implemented multiprocessing to run the analysis in a separate process, improving the responsiveness of the GUI.
 - Issues: We faced challenges with sharing data between the GUI and the processing functions, such as errors related to pickling.
 - Resolution: We used a Manager to manage shared data, allowing smooth communication between processes. This approach was tested thoroughly to ensure stability and correct functioning.
Planned Enhancements: Further optimizations are planned to reduce the RAM and CPU usage of the tool, making it more efficient for longer analyses and larger datasets.

8. Finalization and User Instructions
Directory Naming: We added a feature to name the results directory with the stock ticker and the current date and time, ensuring that each analysis run is stored separately.
User Instructions: Once the analysis is complete, users are provided with instructions to access the results and view the interactive dashboard. This was implemented in the detail window of the GUI.
Testing and Validation: The final system was tested with various stock tickers to ensure that it works as expected across different scenarios. We validated the outputs and the user experience to ensure the tool is robust and reliable.

Version 2.0 Enhancements
- Progress Bar: I added a progress bar to visually indicate the progress of the analysis.
- Progress Text: A progress text feature was introduced to give users a clear understanding of what stage the analysis is in.
- Running... Animation: A "Running..." animation was added to indicate that the analysis is ongoing and has not stalled.
- Clear Completion Text: Upon completion, users are given clear instructions on where to find the results and how to view them.
- Performance Improvements: I optimized the code to improve performance, reducing the tool's RAM and CPU usage and making the analysis faster and more efficient.

This README provides a detailed overview of the tool's functionality, the issues encountered during development, and the solutions implemented. The project is a robust, automated tool for stock analysis, designed to be both powerful and user-friendly. Further improvements are planned to enhance performance and usability.
